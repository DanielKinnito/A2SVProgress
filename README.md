## Introduction

This repository is designed to help students and enthusiasts of Data Structures and Algorithms by providing solutions to common problems from popular coding platforms. The solutions are organized weekly, reflecting the typical structure of a DSA course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each week. Within each week's directory, you will find subdirectories for LeetCode and Codeforces problems, containing the question statements and their respective solutions.

dsa-questions-answers/
├── Week_Name/
│ ├── LeetCode/
│ │ ├── problem1_solution.py
│ │ └── problem2_solution.py
│ └── Codeforces/
│ └── problem1_solution.cpp
├── Week_Nme/
│ ├── LeetCode/
│ └── Codeforces/


## How to Use

1. **Navigating the Repository:**
   - Each week is a folder containing subfolders for LeetCode and Codeforces.(Some onlly LeetCode)
   - Inside each problem folder, you will find a solution file (`.py`, `.cpp`, etc.) with the code.

2. **Viewing Solutions:**
   - Search the name of the question from the respective website the question is from.
   - Read the description of the problem
   - Open the corresponding solution file from this repository to see the implemented solution.

3. **Running Solutions:**
   - Make sure you have the necessary environment set up (e.g., Python for `.py` files).
   - Run the solution files in your local development environment to test the solutions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add new solutions or improve existing ones, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

Please make sure your contributions adhere to the repository's structure and coding standards.

Happy coding and happy learning!
